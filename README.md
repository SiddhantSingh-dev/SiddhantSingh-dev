- 👋 Hi, I’m @SiddhantSingh-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain, dAPP, web-development, algorithms & data-structures, and low level programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain smart chain development on the binance smart chain platform. I am also learning algorithms and data-structures in Java. I plan on learning web development at some point during this summer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Solidity related project. I would also love to develop applications using the JVM and Java.
